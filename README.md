Hi Julio, Robert, Robertson, Naman and Alisha, welcome to our group github page and our project repository. I will give you a run down on how to use Electron.js and how to create functions, work on html and css and hopefully passing this class.

## Getting Started

First, make sure that you have Node.js in your computer, to do that, you have to first download (obviously) node.js

* [Node JS ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then make sure you clone this github repository, to learn more on how to do that, follow the link below and read up on it.

* [Github tut](https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners)

Once you download the clone of this repository in your computer, you can then open the command prompt window in your computer. To do that, search for command prompt by pressing the window button and s at the same time and then a search box will appear. Type in "command prompt" and the program will come up.

Then, hopefully you will know some command line phrases to find the clone repository folder.

However, when you do get to that folder, you can type in

```
npm install
```
and then

```
npm start
```
to start running the program and what we have so far. Electron js is pretty good at updating the program as you make changes. So if you change something in the index.html and save it, then the program window will update accordingly.


### Functionality

To make the function works in this program, you have to first write the code for it in javascript and then put that code in the **renderer.js** file. That way the html, css and html will all be in different files.

###Branching not master

Make sure that you guys are branching out your own functionality and work, so that we are not deleting files or codes from the master branch. If you don't know how to create a branch, you can create a new repository in the **djrand1** main folder and add your files there. I can add your code to this repository once you are finish.

### End

This is all I have for right now, please let me know what else I should add to this documentation. If you have any questions, please feel free to slack me, Dac.
